# Generative AI Course Notebook

This is a notebook for my Generative AI (GenAI) course, curated from Pluralsight courses. The course is designed for enthusiasts and beginners, providing a comprehensive understanding of generative AI models, prompt engineering, model architecture, prototyping, evaluation, and ethical considerations.

## Description

This self-paced learning path guides you through the world of generative AI models, demonstrating how to use prompts as input to generate desired output. Each course builds on the previous, providing a structured approach to learning.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of generative AI and its applications.
