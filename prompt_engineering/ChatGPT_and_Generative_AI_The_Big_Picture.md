## Generative AI
Any type of AI that can be used to  create new text, images, video, audio, code or synthetic data.
Eg: Dall-E, Chat-GPT

## Discriminative AI
"Discriminative AI" generally refers to artificial intelligence systems or models that focus on learning the decision boundary between different classes or categories in data. In machine learning, models are broadly categorized as either discriminative or generative.

**Discriminative Models:**
- **Objective:** Discriminative models aim to model the conditional probability of the output (label) given the input features.
- **Focus:** They focus on learning the boundary that separates different classes in the input space.
- **Example:** Support Vector Machines (SVM), logistic regression, and neural networks trained for classification tasks are examples of discriminative models.

**Generative Models:**
- **Objective:** Generative models aim to model the joint probability of both the input features and the output.
- **Focus:** They aim to learn the underlying distribution of the data, allowing for the generation of new samples.
- **Example:** Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and certain types of neural networks (like Variational Autoencoders) are generative models.

The term "discriminative AI" is often used in the context of supervised learning tasks, where the model is trained to discriminate between different classes based on labeled examples. Discriminative models are particularly effective when the goal is to make accurate predictions or classifications.

It's important to note that the choice between discriminative and generative models depends on the specific task and the goals of the model. Discriminative models are commonly used in tasks like image classification, natural language processing, and other classification problems where the focus is on making accurate predictions for specific classes.
